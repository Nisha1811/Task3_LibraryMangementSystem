# Library Management System (Single-File Java OOP Project)

This is a simple Java console application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It lets you manage a library system where you can add books, view the catalog, issue books, and return them — all using one Java file.

---

## Project Description

This project was created as part of a Java Developer Internship task to practice real-world Java OOP concepts in a console-based environment.

The program includes:
- A `Book` class to represent each book
- A `Library` class to manage the collection of books
- Basic functionality to **Add**, **Issue**, **Return**, and **View** books
- All classes are written in one file for simplicity

---

##  Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Scanner class for console input
- ArrayList to store book records
- Terminal or any Java-supporting IDE (like VS Code or IntelliJ)

---

##  File Included

- `LibraryManagementSystem.java` – contains all classes (`Book`, `User`, `Library`, `Main`) in a single file

---

##  How to Run

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   javac LibraryManagementSystem.java
